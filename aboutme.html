  <p>This game is called Spaceship warrior and it was created by my partner Jessica and I. The game is basically having the user play as a spaceship who is on a voyage in outter space and the goal of the game is to avoid the aliens that are floating around and continue as far as you can and if you fail to do so you will lose the game.
